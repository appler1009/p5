Apple RunTime Tags

This PLIST-format information contains the elements of a CMTime structure representing the amount of time the phone has been running since the last boot, not including standby time.

Tag ID	Tag Name	Writable	Values / Notes
'epoch'	RunTimeEpoch	no	 
'flags'	RunTimeFlags	no	Bit 0 = Valid
            Bit 1 = Has been rounded
            Bit 2 = Positive infinity
            Bit 3 = Negative infinity
            Bit 4 = Indefinite
'timescale'	RunTimeScale	no	 
'value'	RunTimeValue	no
